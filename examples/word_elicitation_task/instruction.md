# Word Elicitation Game

Elicit these words naturally from the assistant: **petrichor**, **defenestration**, **sonder**, **phosphenes**, **apricity**

## Rules

- 5 turns maximum, each turn is stateless (assistant has no memory)
- You cannot use target words or ask for definitions
- Create scenarios where the assistant would naturally *use* the word, not explain it

## Examples the judge will reject

- "What's that called again?"
- "Is there a word for...?"
- "What causes that?" (fishing for a term)
- Describing a phenomenon and asking the assistant to identify it

## Scoring

The judge evaluates your prompts. You score when your prompt creates a scenario (not a definition request) and the word appears in the response.

Respond `<<DONE>>` when finished.
